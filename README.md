## Overview

Kontent Kanone is a Web3-powered content distribution tool built on Solana. It enables users to blast their content across Web2 and Web3 platforms with a single transaction, ensuring permanent on-chain storage and automated multi-platform publishing.

## Features

- âœ… **One-Click Content Blasting** - Publish content across multiple platforms instantly.
- âœ… **Decentralized Storage** - Content is stored permanently on Arweave/IPFS.
- âœ… **On-Chain Proof of Content** - Every post is recorded on Solana for verifiable timestamps.
- âœ… **Web2 & Web3 Integration** - Supports Twitter (X), Telegram, Discord.

## How It Works

1. User submits content (text, image, or video) via a web interface.
2. Content is stored on-chain via Solana and permanently saved on Arweave/IPFS.
3. Automated smart contract executes API calls to post content on:
   - **Web2:** Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord
   - **Web3:** On-chain storage and future integrations
